    "contents": "\r\nThe data concerns vaccination coverage for diptheria,tetanus, polio (DTP) and measles, mumps, rubella (MMR). The data included here only covers the Greater Toronto Area for both public and Catholic schools.  For further details about the source data, please visit Toronto Public Health 2018-2019 Immunization Survey.\r\nLet’s first lay out some questions to ask from the data.  - Is there a relationship between school size and vaccination coverage?  - Are there differences between the two vaccines in terms of coverage rates?  - What sort of schools have low vaccination rates and high exemption rates?  - How are schools with low coverage situated? Are they clustered or randomly located? \r\nExploratory Analysis\r\nFirst, load the necessary R packages for the analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(dplyr) # data manipulation package that's part of the tidyverse\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)  #  data visualization\r\nlibrary(patchwork)#adjust arrangement of plots\r\nlibrary(plotly) # generate interactive graphics for HTML documents\r\nlibrary(DT) # provides filtering, pagination, sorting, and many other features in the tables\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLoad the data\r\nThere are two possibilities:\r\nTo download directly from Opendata Toronto, use the provided script to directly access the API:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(opendatatoronto)\r\n\r\npackage <- show_package(\"99ff3657-b2e7-4005-a6fd-c36838ccc96d\") # get package\r\nresources <- list_package_resources(\"99ff3657-b2e7-4005-a6fd-c36838ccc96d\") # get all resources for this package\r\n\r\n# identify datastore resources; by default, Toronto Open Data sets datastore resource format to CSV for\r\n# non-geospatial and GeoJSON for geospatial resources\r\ndatastore_resources <- filter(resources, tolower(format) %in% c('csv', 'geojson'))\r\n\r\n# load the first datastore resource as a sample\r\ndata <- filter(datastore_resources, row_number()==1) %>% get_resource()\r\nglimpse(data)\r\n\r\n\r\nRows: 808\r\nColumns: 9\r\n$ `_id`                              <int> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...\r\n$ `School Name`                      <chr> \"A Y JACKSON SECONDARY...\r\n$ `Enrolled population`              <int> 1070, 110, 247, 66, 12...\r\n$ `DTP coverage rate (%)`            <dbl> 91.0, 88.2, 91.9, 71.2...\r\n$ `DTP Religious exemption rate (%)` <dbl> 1.0, 1.8, 3.6, 19.7, 1...\r\n$ `MMR coverage rate (%)`            <dbl> 95.7, 90.0, 94.3, 72.7...\r\n$ `MMR Religious exemption rate (%)` <dbl> 1.0, 1.8, 3.6, 19.7, 1...\r\n$ Lat                                <dbl> 43.80526, 43.76242, 43...\r\n$ Lng                                <dbl> -79.36656, -79.17977, ...\r\n\r\n 2. Some people have their data stored as Google Sheets, so using the R package googlesheets4 is a convenient, alternative way of loading your file.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(googlesheets4)\r\n#data<-read_sheet('googlesheet file location URL')\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView data\r\nWe have the following columns which are rather long. So I’ll rename them. - id  - School name  - Enrolled population  - Percentage of students vaccinated for DTP  - Percentage of students with a religious exemption for DTP  - Percentage of students vaccinated for MMR  - Percentage of students with a religious exemption for DTP  - Location of school via latitude and longitude \r\n\r\n\r\ndata<-data %>% rename(school =\"School Name\",\r\n                      enrolled = \"Enrolled population\", \r\n                      dtp_pct= \"DTP coverage rate (%)\", \r\n                      dtp_exempt =\"DTP Religious exemption rate (%)\",\r\n                      mmr_pct = \"MMR coverage rate (%)\", \r\n                      mmr_exempt = \"MMR Religious exemption rate (%)\",\r\n                      lat= 'Lat',\r\n                      lon= 'Lng')\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudent enrollment\r\nLet’s first look at the overall student population in a total of 808 schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#total student population\r\ntotal_student_population<- data %>%  summarise(sum(enrolled)) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a total of 242769 students, and the most populous schools are:\r\n\r\n\r\n# largest student population\r\nlarge_schools <- data %>% arrange(desc(enrolled))\r\nhead(large_schools$school,12)\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] \"MICHAEL POWER/ST JOSEPH HIGH SCHOOL\"           \r\n [2] \"EARL HAIG SECONDARY SCHOOL\"                    \r\n [3] \"MARC GARNEAU COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE\"             \r\n [4] \"NORTHERN SECONDARY SCHOOL\"                     \r\n [5] \"NORTHVIEW HEIGHTS SECONDARY SCHOOL\"            \r\n [6] \"BISHOP ALLEN ACADEMY CATHOLIC SECONDARY SCHOOL\"\r\n [7] \"WILLIAM LYON MACKENZIE COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE\"   \r\n [8] \"SENATOR O'CONNOR COLLEGE SCHOOL\"               \r\n [9] \"SIR WILFRID LAURIER COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE\"      \r\n[10] \"LESTER B PEARSON COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE\"         \r\n[11] \"NORTH TORONTO COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE\"            \r\n[12] \"ST JOHN PAUL II CATHOLIC SECONDARY SCHOOL\"     \r\n\r\nWhat about the smaller schools?\r\n\r\n\r\nsmall_schools <- data %>% arrange(enrolled)\r\nhead(small_schools$school,12)\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] \"MONSIGNOR FRASER COLLEGE (ST.

But does this difference in school size affect vaccination coverage? Let’s look at the vaccination rates to see if there is an association between school size and vaccination rates. \r\nOverall vaccination coverage\r\nThe vaccination rates provided only relate to the DTP and MMR vaccines, and exclude medical exemptions. They also do not account for incomplete vaccine data (i.e students not yet at the appropriate age for receiving a particular vaccine). Therefore, you may have noticed that the percentages do not add up to 100.  Here’s a summary for DTP coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\ndata %>% summarize(mean=mean(dtp_pct),\r\n                   median=median(dtp_pct),\r\n                   iqr=IQR(dtp_pct),\r\n                   std=sd(dtp_pct),\r\n                   se=sd(dtp_pct)/sqrt(808))\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 x 5\r\n   mean median   iqr   std    se\r\n  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\r\n1  90.0     91  6.52  7.30 0.257\r\n\r\nThe mean and median levels are similar, and the the interquartile range isn’t very large. This tells us that the overall vaccination coverage for DTP is high among most schools.\r\nDTP and MMR coverage\r\nPlotting enrollment and DTP coverage together (with the median shown with the red

rates to confer herd immunity in a population are dependent on infectiousness of a particular disease. For example, in measles (covered through MMR) it is expected to be over 92%, and Diptheria (through DTP) it is over 83%.  Looking at the Toronto vaccination coverage, there are some schools (outliers) with very low coverage rates for both vaccines.  If a distribution is heavily skewed (i.e. not normal and with outliers), it is generally not advisable to pick the mean as a summary statistic. In this case the mean is close to the median, but I still prefer to use the median values as a measure of central tendency because of the presence outliers. \r\nWe see similar distributions for both vaccines, with most schools having a coverage rate of over 80%. The median coverage rate for MMR is slightly larger than for DTP (93.6 vs 91 %), with a larger spread of data for DTP. But this may be due to incomplete vaccination records based on the age of the student (the 2nd dose of MMR vaccines are given after the age of 48 months, which is after the starting age for Junior Kindergarten).  So answer the question “Is there a relationship between school size and vaccination coverage?”\r\nThere isn’t a defined relationship between school size and vaccination coverage, but clearly the schools with low coverage are smaller schools.\r\nSchools with low vaccination coverage\r\nLet’s look at the schools that have lower vaccination rates for both vaccines. The graph below flips the axes so you can get an idea of the high coverage rates.\r\nFirst DTP.\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 x 1\r\n    med\r\n  <dbl>\r\n1    91\r\n\r\nAS you can see, the distribution is heavily skewed to the left with most schools over 80% coverage and a median of 91%.  If we pick the schools with DTP coverage rate less than the overall median value, we can get a closer look at which schools have not only low vaccination rates, but also relatively high rates of religious exemptions. I picked the first quartile(Q1) as the cutoff (i.e containing the lowest 25% of the population).\r\nIn the case of DTP, this is a coverage rate of 87.8%.\r\n\r\n\r\nquantile(data$dtp_pct)\r\n\r\n\r\n     0%     25%     50%     75%    100% \r\n 26.700  87.800  91.000  94.325 100.000 \r\n\r\nlow_vac <- data %>% filter(dtp_pct <87.8) %>% arrange((dtp_pct)) #filter for vaccination rate less than 91%\r\ndatatable(low_vac[,c(2,3,4,6)])\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"10\",\"11\",\"12\",\"13\",\"14\",\"15\",\"16\",\"17\",\"18\",\"19\",\"20\",\"21\",\"22\",\"23\",\"24\",\"25\",\"26\",\"27\",\"28\",\"29\",\"30\",\"31\",\"32\",\"33\",\"34\",\"35\",\"36\",\"37\",\"38\",\"39\",\"40\",\"41\",\"42\",\"43\",\"44\",\"45\",\"46\",\"47\",\"48\",\"49\",\"50\",\"51\",\"52\",\"53\",\"54\",\"55\",\"56\",\"57\",\"58\",\"59\",\"60\",\"61\",\"62\",\"63\",\"64\",\"65\",\"66\",\"67\",\"68\",\"69\",\"70\",\"71\",\"72\",\"73\",\"74\",\"75\",\"76\",\"77\",\"78\",\"79\",\"80\",\"81\",\"82\",\"83\",\"84\",\"85\",\"86\",\"87\",\"88\",\"89\",\"90\",\"91\",\"92\",\"93\",\"94\",\"95\",\"96\",\"97\",\"98\",\"99\",\"100\",\"101\",\"102\",\"103\",\"104\",\"105\",\"106\",\"107\",\"108\",\"109\",\"110\",\"111\",\"112\",\"113\",\"114\",\"115\",\"116\",\"117\",\"118\",\"119\",\"120\",\"121\",\"122\",\"123\",\"124\",\"125\",\"126\",\"127\",\"128\",\"129\",\"130\",\"131\",\"132\",\"133\",\"134\",\"135\",\"136\",\"137\",\"138\",\"139\",\"140\",\"141\",\"142\",\"143\",\"144\",\"145\",\"146\",\"147\",\"148\",\"149\",\"150\",\"151\",\"152\",\"153\",\"154\",\"155\",\"156\",\"157\",\"158\",\"159\",\"160\",\"161\",\"162\",\"163\",\"164\",\"165\",\"166\",\"167\",\"168\",\"169\",\"170\",\"171\",\"172\",\"173\",\"174\",\"175\",\"176\",\"177\",\"178\",\"179\",\"180\",\"181\",\"182\",\"183\",\"184\",\"185\",\"186\",\"187\",\"188\",\"189\",\"190\",\"191\",\"192\",\"193\",\"194\",\"195\",\"196\",\"197\",\"198\",\"199\",\"200\"],[\"MONSIGNOR FRASER COLLEGE (ST.

Exemption rates\r\nThe data provided by Toronto Public Health identifies religious exemptions for each of these vaccines. Let’s get a summary of that data for each vaccine.  Looking at the raw data, the exemption rate is exactly the same for both vaccines, so we can conclude that those who applied for exemptions did so for both.\r\n\r\n\r\ndtp_exempt_summary<-data %>% summarize(mean=mean(dtp_exempt),\r\n                   median=median(dtp_exempt),\r\n                   iqr=IQR(dtp_exempt),\r\n                   std=sd(dtp_exempt),\r\n                   se=sd(dtp_exempt)/sqrt(808))\r\ndtp_exempt_summary\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 x 5\r\n   mean median   iqr   std    se\r\n  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\r\n1  2.11    1.4  2.13  3.04 0.107\r\n\r\nThe religious exemption rate is quite low overall. If we look at a histogram of the data, it is very clear that most schools have a rate less than 5%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is clearly surprising is there are a couple of schools even over 5% of the population reporting religious exemptions for both vaccines.

Does location have anything to do with it?\r\nIn order to spatially and interactively view the schools, I am using a simple method: The leaflet package is R package that enables users to control leaflet maps, which are an open-source, javascript library for generating interactive maps.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(leaflet)\r\nlibrary(RDSTK)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndtp_exempt_plot<- leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 0, maxZoom = 15)) %>%    \r\n  addTiles() %>%  \r\n  addMarkers(lng= dtp_exempt_table$lon, lat=dtp_exempt_table$lat, popup=dtp_exempt_table$school,dtp_exempt$dtp_exempt)\r\ndtp_exempt_plot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":15,\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"//{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy;

If these schools are outliers compared to the larger schools, how can we explain the extremely low exemption rates in large school. The low coverage schools are not advertised as dedicated for individuals with exemptions for vaccines so there are many questions that can be further investigated:  - Do these schools function as schools solely dedicated for those families who chose not to vaccinate their children?  - If not, why is there a disparity compared to larger schools?  - Is there a selection process for students to attend?  - Is the selection process impartial, or biased towards families seeking medical or religious exemptions?  - Do students with medical or religious exemptions congregate in particular schools for another reason? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
