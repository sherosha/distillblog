<!--/radix_placeholder_categories-->
<p><p>This is a summary of 2018-2019 immunization data from Toronto Public Health.</p></p>
</div>


<div class="d-article">
<p>The data concerns vaccination coverage for diptheria,tetanus, polio (DTP) and measles, mumps, rubella (MMR). The data included here only covers the Greater Toronto Area for both public and Catholic schools. <br> For further details about the source data, please visit <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/research-reports/public-health-significant-reports/toronto-schools-immunization-coverage-rates/">Toronto Public Health 2018-2019 Immunization Survey</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s first lay out some questions to ask from the data. <br> - Is there a relationship between school size and vaccination coverage? <br> - Are there differences between the two vaccines in terms of coverage rates? <br> - What sort of schools have low vaccination rates and high exemption rates? <br> - How are schools with low coverage situated? Are they clustered or randomly located? <br></p>

<p><br> Clearly, there is a disparity in terms of student enrollment. But does this difference in school size affect vaccination coverage?<br> Let’s look at the vaccination rates to see if there is an association between school size and vaccination rates. <br></p>
<h2 id="overall-vaccination-coverage">Overall vaccination coverage</h2>
<p>The vaccination rates provided only relate to the DTP and MMR vaccines, and exclude medical exemptions. They also do not account for incomplete vaccine data (i.e students not yet at the appropriate age for receiving a particular vaccine).<br> Therefore, you may have noticed that the percentages do not add up to 100. <br> Here’s a summary for DTP coverage.</p>

<p>The mean and median levels are similar, and the the interquartile range isn’t very large. This tells us that the overall vaccination coverage for DTP is high among most schools.<br></p>

<p>Let’s look at MMR..</p>

<p>Vaccination rates to confer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity">herd immunity</a> in a population are dependent on infectiousness of a particular disease. For example, in measles (covered through MMR) it is expected to be over 92%, and Diptheria (through DTP) it is over 83%. <br> Looking at the Toronto vaccination coverage, there are some schools (outliers) with very low coverage rates for both vaccines. <br> If a distribution is heavily skewed (i.e. not normal and with outliers), it is generally not advisable to pick the mean as a summary statistic. In this case the mean is close to the median, but I still prefer to use the median values as a measure of central tendency because of the presence outliers. <br></p>
<p>We see similar distributions for both vaccines, with most schools having a coverage rate of over 80%. The median coverage rate for MMR is slightly larger than for DTP (93.6 vs 91 %), with a larger spread of data for DTP. But this may be due to incomplete vaccination records based on the age of the student (the 2nd dose of MMR vaccines are given after the age of 48 months, which is after the starting age for Junior Kindergarten). <br> So answer the question “Is there a relationship between school size and vaccination coverage?”</p>
<p>There isn’t a defined relationship between school size and vaccination coverage, but clearly the <strong>schools with low coverage are smaller schools</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="schools-with-low-vaccination-coverage">Schools with low vaccination coverage</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the schools that have lower vaccination rates for both vaccines. The graph below flips the axes so you can get an idea of the high coverage rates.</p>
<p>First DTP.</p>

</div>
<p>AS you can see, the distribution is heavily skewed to the left with most schools over 80% coverage and a median of 91%. <br> If we pick the schools with DTP coverage rate less than the overall median value, we can get a closer look at which schools have not only low vaccination rates, but also relatively high rates of religious exemptions. I picked the first quartile(Q1) as the cutoff (i.e containing the lowest 25% of the population).</p>
<p>In the case of DTP, this is a coverage rate of 87.8%.</p>

<h2 id="religious-exemption-rates">Religious Exemption rates</h2>
<p>The data provided by Toronto Public Health identifies religious exemptions for each of these vaccines. Let’s get a summary of that data for each vaccine. <br> Looking at the raw data, the exemption rate is exactly the same for both vaccines, so we can conclude that those who applied for exemptions did so for <em>both</em>.</p>

<p>What is clearly surprising is there are a couple of schools even over 5% of the population reporting religious exemptions for both vaccines. These schools are overwhelmingly smaller schools.</p>

<p>It is clear from both the vaccination and exemption rates, the 55 schools with religious exemption rates are small, specialized schools (except Rosedale Heights School of the Arts) with under 500 students.</p>
<h2 id="spatial-plotting">Spatial plotting</h2>
<p>What differentiates these schools with low vaccination coverage rates? The observations above point to them being smaller, specialized schools. Does location have anything to do with it?</p>
<p>In order to spatially and interactively view the schools, I am using a simple method: The <a href="http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">leaflet</a> package is R package that enables users to control leaflet maps, which are an open-source, javascript library for generating interactive maps.</p>

<p>Clearly the schools are dispersed randomly and in both densely populated and suburban areas.<br></p>
<p>The take-away from this investigation is that the smaller schools are heavily concentrated with students who have religious exemptions for the two main childhood vaccines, DTP and MMR. <br> If these schools are outliers compared to the larger schools, how can we explain the extremely low exemption rates in large school. The low coverage schools are not advertised as dedicated for individuals with exemptions for vaccines so there are many questions that can be further investigated: <br> - Do these schools function as schools solely dedicated for those families who chose not to vaccinate their children? <br> - If not, why is there a disparity compared to larger schools? <br> - Is there a selection process for students to attend? <br> - Is the selection process impartial, or biased towards families seeking medical or religious exemptions? <br> - Do students with medical or religious exemptions congregate in particular schools for another reason? <br></p>
